\header{Profile}
\indent\small{I am a Robotics Engineer with over a decade of extensive experience in mechanical analysis and software development for robotics applications. Throughout my career, I have held several positions where I designed and developed a wide range of robots, including industrial-grade 6DOF serial manipulators, 2500kg Stewart platforms, and mobile construction excavators. Most of the products I was involved in were designed as commercial products with tight deadlines and resulted in successful, profitable products. I have also demonstrated my ability to manage robotics teams, as seen in my previous role as robotics team manager at Hamgar Toos. My enthusiasm, professionalism, expertise, and experience in both mechanical and software development make me a valuable resource for your company.}
